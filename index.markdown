My name is Joshua Cachola and I am an aspiring software engineer. My studies began at DeAnza College learning C and C++. My journey of failing miserably to understand concepts like pointers and objects to the satisfaction of using those same concepts to building simple programs is what lead me to pursue Computer Science in college. There was no other subject in school that made me feel as accomplished and proud for all of the hours of hard work. 

As I transferred and continued on with my upper division classes at CSU East Bay I continued to build upon the foundation carried over from DeAnza College. I challenged myself by taking a cirriculum that would be necessary for graduate school. These courses were automata and computation, analysis of algorithms, and artificial intelligence just to highlight a few of them. In the summer of 2019 was able to graduate from CSU East Bay.

After I graduated I had a few options in front of me that I wanted to pursue. One option was to take the GRE and wait a year to enroll into a graduate school program and the other option was to apply to a coding bootcamp. As I studied for the GRE I decided to apply to App Academy to get a better understanding of their cirriculum. As I weighed my options, the video reviews and previous student testimonials is why I eventually enrolled in their Full Stack Software Engineering program.
